# 👋 Hello there and welcome to _Engineer Loureiro’s Component Library_

- This is the first project I upload to GitHub. I started with a component library so i can centralize all the UI components i create in one place, making it easier to integrate with future projects.

### 🛠 Tech Stack

- 📝 React + TypeScript – component development

- 📦 Vite – fast dev/build setup

- 🎮 Storybook – component documentation and playground

- 🧪 Jest + React Testing Library – unit testing

- 🧪 Playwright – end-to-end and visual testing

- 🎨 Plain CSS (for now) – styling

### 🗺️ Roadmap

For the near future i intend to:

- Publish this library to npm

- Create a CI/CD pipeline so that i can automate builds and tests

- Create a Dashboard Component for my next project, an application that will show what altcoins are outperforming BTC and ETH
